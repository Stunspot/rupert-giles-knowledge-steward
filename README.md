# Rupert Giles Knowledge Steward

![An illuminated canonical folio anchors a governed archive while provenance threads connect derivatives, conflicts, and recovery copies.](docs/assets/rupert-giles-hero.png)

> **Map the estate. Name the authority. Preserve the recovery path.**

Rupert Giles Knowledge Steward governs knowledge estates as both libraries and chains of custody. It begins from the questions people need answered, maps what actually exists, separates exact identity from semantic role, preserves provenance and authority claims, stages material changes, and keeps recovery possible.

## Start from retrieval journeys

A useful knowledge system answers the questions its people actually ask. Begin with representative journeys before choosing folders, tags, naming conventions, or tools.

```text
Use $rupert-giles-knowledge-steward to map this knowledge estate before
proposing changes. Begin from the retrieval journeys we need to support;
distinguish inventory, exact identity, provenance, authority role, and
disposition; surface collisions and exceptions; stage a reversible mapping
with exact targets and recovery paths; and do not move, merge, deduplicate, or
delete anything without explicit authority.
```

Good retrieval journeys include imperfect recall, alternate vocabulary, uncertain dates or versions, cross-cutting subjects, and the need to distinguish “latest-looking” from “authoritative.”

## Preserve four separate ledgers

Do not infer one ledger from another.

| Ledger | What it records | What it does not establish |
|---|---|---|
| **Inventory** | What exists, where, size, type, time, readable metadata, and inspection state. | Exact sameness, authority, or intended disposition. |
| **Identity** | Hashes or other evidence of exact byte identity where the decision requires it. | Shared custodial role or semantic equivalence. |
| **Provenance** | Origin, custody, transformations, source relation, and authority claims. | That the source is factually correct. |
| **Disposition** | Retain, relocate, copy, convert, quarantine, review, or delete—with authority and recovery. | That a proposed action was executed. |

Matching titles do not prove identity. Recent modification does not prove authority. Identical bytes may serve different workflows. A persuasive proposal is still only a proposal until an authorized change is observed.

## Keep artifact role separate from identity

The steward distinguishes:

- **canonical source** — the governed artifact authorized to settle a defined class of question;
- **authored derivative** — a transformed explanation, summary, adaptation, or working artifact with traceable lineage;
- **export** — a delivery copy whose convenience does not make it the source of truth;
- **backup** — a recovery artifact with retention and restoration rules;
- **cache** — a rebuildable acceleration artifact governed by freshness and eviction;
- **generated output** — a proposal or derivative that cannot promote itself into canon.

Two identical files may have different custodial roles. Two different files may claim the same canonical role. Both situations need explicit evidence and resolution rather than filename astrology.

## Design for finding, not merely sorting

Choose a primary structure that matches the dominant retrieval journeys, then add metadata, indexes, aliases, or saved searches for cross-cutting access. A perfect hierarchy is usually a false promise.

Test information scent:

- Can someone who did not design the system predict where to look?
- Can they recognize the right artifact before opening every candidate?
- Can they tell whether it is current, authoritative, sensitive, superseded, or merely similar?
- Can an exception resist the primary taxonomy without disappearing into `miscellaneous`?

Preserve an exception ledger where one taxonomy cannot honestly contain reality.

## Change safely

Map first. Propose second. Change only with explicit authority.

1. **Bound the estate.** Record included and excluded locations, sensitivity, readable material, and authorized read/write operations.
2. **Inventory before.** Preserve locations, roles, identity evidence, collisions, and unresolved authority claims.
3. **Stage the mapping.** Present exact targets, rationale, naming collisions, reversibility, and the retained recovery path.
4. **Prefer reversible moves.** Copy, quarantine, or maintain a move ledger when destruction has not been clearly authorized.
5. **Verify destinations.** Confirm target state and at least one validated canonical copy before removing a source.
6. **Inventory after.** Compare before and after state, record exceptions, and test representative retrieval journeys.

“Clean this up” is not blanket permission to erase. Before a move, rename, merge, deduplication, or deletion, expose the exact targets and retained recovery route.

## Maintain the estate

A clean snapshot without a maintenance path is temporary performance, not stewardship. Define:

- intake requirements and quarantine treatment;
- naming, version, alias, and metadata rules;
- authority owners and review cadence;
- freshness, conflict, supersession, and deprecation triggers;
- backup custody, restoration tests, move ledgers, and rollback paths.

For work spanning more than a few artifacts, use [`assets/knowledge-estate-ledger.template.md`](assets/knowledge-estate-ledger.template.md) to preserve scope, authority, inventory, collisions, retrieval validation, proposed and executed change, and recovery state across turns.

## Inspection and evidence language

When content cannot be inspected, state the actual condition:

- not supplied;
- not examined;
- unreadable;
- inaccessible;
- outside scope;
- genuinely absent.

Unread is not absent. Similar is not identical. Proposed is not executed. Provenance is not factual truth.

## Repository map

- [`SKILL.md`](SKILL.md) — operating contract for the knowledge steward;
- [`references/stewardship-doctrine.md`](references/stewardship-doctrine.md) — retrieval journeys, four-ledger model, taxonomy, safe change, and maintenance doctrine;
- [`assets/knowledge-estate-ledger.template.md`](assets/knowledge-estate-ledger.template.md) — resumable estate record;
- [`docs/`](docs/) — tailored static project site and generated raster artwork;
- [`docs/SITE-SOURCE.md`](docs/SITE-SOURCE.md) — site claims, source custody, deployment, and review boundary;
- [`.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml`](.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml) — official GitHub Pages deployment workflow.

## Boundaries

The steward can map, compare, propose, and preserve custody. It does not invent an accountable canon owner, treat provenance as proof of truth, silently collapse contradictions, or convert an ambiguous cleanup request into destructive authority.

Completion requires a navigable estate, explicit authoritative roles, a visible distinction between proposed and executed changes, a viable recovery path, and a maintainable intake and review practice.
